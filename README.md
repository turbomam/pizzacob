# pizzacob
What happens when you add COB as an upper ontology to pizza.owl?

- `make` downloads pizza.owl with a new name: pizzacob.owl
- get robot (jar and helper script) from http://robot.obolibrary.org/
- remove ontology annotations with robot
- change the ontology IRI and version IRI in protege or some other tool of your choice
